## [Flag Submission](flag-submit)

This tool automatically submits flag for team. Provide either individual flag or file which stores multiple flags for submission. Change the `TEAM_INTERFACE_IP` and 
`TEAM_FLAG_TOKEN` variables according to team's information before running the script.

## [Auto Search Flag](auto-search-flag)

This tool exploits the backup service, find and submit obtained flags automatically.

## [Firewall](onestone-firewall)

This tool sets up the firewall to protect our services from attacks and capture packet for analysis. 

## [Vulnerability scan](vulnerability-scan)

This tool automatically scans defined vulnerabilities in C or PHP file.

## [Auto exploit scripts](auto-exploit-script)

These are all the scripts that the team have developped during the game. Each script targets a specific service. The script automatically exploits the service, obtains flags, filters and submits them to server.

    File: 

        scp -i key_file file_dir ctf@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/home/ctf

    Folder: 

        scp -i key_file -r folder_dir ctf@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/home/ctf
